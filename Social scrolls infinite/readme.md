## What you mean rendering a Large List

When you try to render a large dataset all at once in your UI (for example, thousands of posts, comments, or images), the browser has to:

- Create many DOM elements.

- Handle layout calculations for each element.

- Manage memory for these elements.

This leads to:
âœ” Slow rendering
âœ” Janky or laggy while scrolling
âœ” High memory consumption
âœ” Poor user experience
